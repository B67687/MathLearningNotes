    "\n",
    "    - A and B must be relatively constant to each other, because it is a proposition.\n",
    "    - My mistake was thinking that A and B are relatively variable to each other, they are not in this case.\n",
    "    - Because if they were, there would be no need for a proposition because anything implies anything is always True, if not it is a definitional paradox.\n",
    "    - Hence A and B are parameters, not variables in a sense, but then again most things with relativity to each other is a parameter, just depends on how big the parameter can encompass.\n",
    "    - In some ways true variables cannot exist meaningfully in mathematics, it must always be relative to something, which means if maintains relative constance somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation of A → B:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Therefore If A → B, is saying that some A → some B.\n",
