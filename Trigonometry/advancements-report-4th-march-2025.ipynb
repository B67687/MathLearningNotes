    "\n",
    "**Formula Derivations & Revisions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sum & Difference Formulas:**\n",
    "    *   Derived using Unit Circle and Distance Formula (new method).\n",
    "    *   Revisited original geometric triangle proof (reinforcement).\n",
    "    *   Analyzed \"genius\" of tangent formula derivation (goal-setting, division by specific terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Double & Half Angle Formulas:**  Derived both.\n",
    "*   **Product-to-Sum & Sum-to-Product Formulas:**\n",
    "    *   Derived using variable substitution.\n",
    "    *   Noted use of cosine's even function property for simplification (normalization to x Â± y).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Co-function Properties:** Revisited and applied in problem-solving (increased application experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications & Problem-Solving:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sum/Difference Formula Application:** Explored optimized partitions for problem-solving (trial & error).\n",
    "*   **Undefined & Indeterminate Forms:** Encountered and researched (need further clarification on difference).\n",
    "    *   *Insight:* Math definitions create potential \"holes\" or edge cases when combining concepts. Mathematical rigidity minimizes these, but they exist due to axiomatic foundations. (Still exploring full resolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function & Inverse Function Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Functions & Definitions:**\n",
    "    *   Revisited vertical/horizontal line tests (reasoning clarified).\n",
    "    *   Confirmed periodic functions are functions (vertical line test), but lack inverses over full domain.\n",
    "*   **Inverse Functions:**\n",
    "    *   Revisited derivation of principal domain and range for inverse trigonometric functions.\n",
    "    *   Understood domain/range inversion in inverse functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meta-Learning & Problem-Solving Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Key Strategies Identified:**\n",
    "    *   Posing \"What-If\" questions.\n",
    "    *   Flexible thinking.\n",
    "    *   Pattern recognition.\n",
    "    *   Shifting goalposts as needed.\n",
    "    *   Prototyping solutions.\n",
    "    *   Variable normalization & fluidity (variables as flexible placeholders).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Triangle Building Exploration (Initial):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Triangle Properties Considered:**\n",
    "    *   3 Angles, 3 Sides - basic components.\n",
    "    *   Angle/Side Constraints: 1 angle restricts 2 sides, 1 side restricts 2 angles (overlapping restrictions are complex).\n",
    "    *   No true \"opposite\" side, all sides adjacent.\n",
    "    *   Angle types: Included, Side, Excluded angles identified.\n",
    "    *   Investigated minimal conditions for triangle formation based on angle/side combinations (SAS, ASA, SAA, SSS, SSA - using Sullivan's Trig as guide for SSA).\n",
    "    *   Noted overlapping restrictions make angle/side combinations non-trivial to analyze by simple addition of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Regulation & Mindset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Balanced Approach:**  Don't push too hard - recognize natural learning flow (Taoism/inaction).\n",
    "*   **Pragmatism:** Consolidate knowledge for long-term retention.\n",
    "*   **Avoid Perfectionism:** \"Starting is better than perfect start.\""
