    "### Introduction to Limits and Intuition\n",
    "  - A limit describes the value $f(x)$ approaches as $x$ gets close to $c$, excluding $x = c$ to focus on the trend.\n",
    "  - Initial understanding relied on logical derivation (e.g., observing behavior as $x$ nears $c$) rather than formal definitions."

    "### Epsilon-Delta (e-d) Definition\n",
    "  - The e-d definition states: $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ if, for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$ implies $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "  - It quantifies closeness: $\\epsilon$ sets the target accuracy for $f(x)$ to $L$, and $\\delta$ controls how close $x$ must be to $c$.\n",
    "  - Excluding $x = c$ ensures the focus is on the approach, not the value at $c$.\n",
    "  - Provides rigor by ensuring uniqueness and consistency, though it can feel like a chore compared to intuitive methods."

    "### Uniqueness of Limits\n",
    "  - Uniqueness is inherent to a function: a limit can’t be two values (e.g., $5$ and $6$) simultaneously.\n",
    "  - The e-d proof confirms uniqueness by showing that if $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L'$ with $L \\neq L'$, the non-overlapping zones (e.g., using $\\epsilon = \\frac{|L - L'|}{2}$) lead to a contradiction.\n",
    "  - The choice of $\\epsilon = \\frac{|L - L'|}{2}$ splits the distance symmetrically, ensuring no overlap, though it feels arbitrary and definitionally special rather than logically derived.\n",
    "  - Suggested improvement: Use a range from $L$ to $L'$ with $\\epsilon = \\frac{|L - L'|}{2}$ centered at the midpoint, making the proof more intuitive and less arbitrary."

    "### My Recursive $\\delta$-Only Model\n",
    "  - Proposed a theoretical model where $\\delta$ shrinks recursively to observe $f(x)$’s behavior, with $x \\neq c$.\n",
    "  - Captures the intuitive idea of limits and inherent uniqueness (e.g., jumps indicate no limit), but lacks $\\epsilon$ for precision.\n",
    "  - Correct but less practical than e-d, serving as a conceptual lens rather than a rigorous tool."

    "### Convergence and Its Inherent Nature\n",

    "  - E-d as archery: $\\epsilon$ is the bullseye size, $\\delta$ is the shooting range, ensuring $f(x)$ hits near $L$.\n",

    "  - Uniqueness as a car race: $f(x)$ can’t cross two finish lines ($L$ and $L'$) simultaneously, proving one limit.\n"

    "### Squeeze Theorem (Range-Limiter Theorem)\n",
    "  - The Squeeze Theorem’s name is misleading—it sounds like it can extract any limit, but it’s really a range-finding tool.\n",
    "  - Renamed the \"Range-Limiter Theorem\": If $h(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq g(x)$ near $c$, the limit of $f(x)$ (if it exists) lies between $\\lim_{x \\to c} h(x)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to c} g(x)$.\n",
    "  - In special cases, if $\\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c} g(x) = L$, the range collapses to a point, giving the exact limit $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$.\n",
    "  - Example: For $\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$, bounds $-x^2 \\leq x^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\leq x^2$ converge to $0$, so the limit is $0$.\n",
    "  - Limitation: Fails when bounds don’t converge to the same value (e.g., $\\frac{1}{x} \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$ at $x \\to 0$, where bounds diverge to $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$).\n",
    "  - Useful for oscillatory functions, but not universal—it’s a specialized range-limiter, not a limit-extractor.\n"

    "### Limits at Specific Points\n",
    "  - $\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0$ via Range-Limiter Theorem due to damping by $x^2$.\n",
    "  - $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{1}{x} \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$ diverges due to $\\frac{1}{x}$’s growth, where Range-Limiter Theorem only constrains the range to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n",
    "  - $\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{1}{x} \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\cos(1)$ via direct substitution, as the function is continuous at $x = 1$."

    "### Complementary Tools\n",
    "  - **Direct Substitution**: Works for continuous functions at $x = c$ (e.g., $x = 1$).\n",

    "  - **L’Hôpital’s Rule**: Handles $\\frac{0}{0}$ or $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$ by taking derivatives (e.g., $\\frac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{x - 1} \\to -\\pi$), intuitively based on rates of change.\n",
    "  - **Series Expansions**: Useful for functions with known Taylor series (e.g., $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\to 1$)."
