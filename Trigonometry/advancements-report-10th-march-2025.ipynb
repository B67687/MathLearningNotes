    "## Summary of Math Concepts Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Foundations & Pre-Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vectors Before Calculus:** Strong recommendation to study **vectors before starting calculus**, especially for fields like physics, engineering, CS, and AI. Vectors build a crucial geometric foundation for multivariable calculus.\n",
    "* **Solid Math Foundation:** Emphasized the importance of a **solid math foundation** (trigonometry and geometry) for vectors and advanced math. Conceptual understanding is key, not just memorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Polar Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polar Coordinates:** Explored **polar coordinates** and their relationship to Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Trigonometric Functions: Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transformations & Periodicity:** Explored coefficients' effects on polar equations and function periods:\n",
    "    - **Inside Coefficients (Angular Frequency) (e.g., $\\cos(k\\theta)$):** Change **periodicity** (tracing speed w.r.t. $\\theta$) and **angular frequency**. $k > 1$ faster (shorter period), $0 < k < 1$ slower (longer period). Period becomes $2\\pi/|k|$.\n",
    "    - **Outside Coefficients (Radial Scale/Amplitude) (e.g., $C \\cos(\\theta)$):** Change **radial scale** or **amplitude**, affecting the overall size of the curve.\n",
    "* **Special Polar Forms:**\n",
    "    - **$r = a \\sec(\\theta)$ and $r = a \\csc(\\theta)$:** Represent **straight lines** ($x = a$ and $y = a$ in Cartesian). \"Flat vertex\" appearance in polar form is inherent to straight lines.\n",
    "* **Fundamental Properties:**\n",
    "    - **Even/Odd Functions:**\n",
    "        - **Cosine ($\\cos \\theta$): Even Function.** $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$. Geometrically explained by x-coordinate invariance under x-axis reflection on the unit circle.\n",
    "        - **Sine ($\\sin \\theta$): Odd Function.** $\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$. Geometrically explained by y-coordinate sign flip under x-axis reflection on the unit circle.\n",
    "        - **Tangent ($\\tan \\theta$): Odd Function.** $\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Deriving from First Principles:** Value of **deriving formulas** (e.g., cosine double-angle to get $\\cos^2(x)$ and $\\sin^2(x)$). Enhances understanding and retention.\n",
    "    - **Refined Periodicity Understanding:** $2\\pi$ period is inherent to the **trig function itself** (cosine, sine) regarding its *input angle*. Coefficients scale this period in terms of input $\\theta$ for functions like $\\cos(k\\theta)$.\n",
    "    - **Ranges of Trigonometric Functions:**\n",
    "        - **Sine ($\\sin \\theta$) and Cosine ($\\cos \\theta$): Bounded Range $[-1, 1]$.**  The values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ are *always* between -1 and 1, inclusive.  This is fundamentally due to their definition on the unit circle as ratios of sides in a right triangle or as coordinates on the unit circle.  This bounded range is crucial in understanding the behavior of these functions and solving trigonometric equations.\n",
    "        - **Secant ($\\sec \\theta$) and Cosecant ($\\csc \\theta$): Unbounded Range $(-\\infty, -1] \\cup [1, \\infty)$.** The values of $\\sec \\theta$ and $\\csc \\theta$ are *always* outside the interval $(-1, 1)$.  Their absolute values are always greater than or equal to 1 ($|\\sec \\theta| \\ge 1$, $|\\csc \\theta| \\ge 1$). This is because they are reciprocals of cosine and sine respectively, and when $\\cos \\theta$ or $\\sin \\theta$ are close to zero, their reciprocals become very large (in magnitude).  Therefore, they have a *minimal absolute value* of 1 and extend to infinity. This is in *direct contrast* to the bounded nature of sine and cosine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Inverse Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverse vs. Direct Trig Functions:**\n",
    "    - **Trigonometric Functions ($\\sin$, $\\cos$, $\\tan$): Angle $\\rightarrow$ Ratio.** Take an **angle** as input and output a **ratio**.\n",
    "    - **Inverse Trigonometric Functions ($\\arcsin$, $\\arccos$, $\\arctan$): Ratio $\\rightarrow$ Angle.** Take a **ratio** as input and output an **angle**. \"Arc-\" prefix signifies finding the *arc* on the unit circle.\n",
    "- **Crucial Note: Principal Domains and Ranges for Inverse Trig Functions:**\n",
    "    - **Inverse trig functions have *principal ranges* to ensure they are well-defined functions (single output for each input).**\n",
    "    - **Always be mindful of these principal ranges when working with inverse trig functions to provide the *principal value* of the angle.**\n",
    "        - **Arccosine ($\\arccos$ or $\\cos^{-1}$): Principal Range is $[0, \\pi]$ (or $[0^\\circ, 180^\\circ]$).**\n",
    "        - **Arcsine ($\\arcsin$ or $\\sin^{-1}$): Principal Range is $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$ (or $[-90^\\circ, 90^\\circ]$).**\n",
    "        - **Arctangent ($\\arctan$ or $\\tan^{-1}$): Principal Range is $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$ (or $(-90^\\circ, 90^\\circ)$).**\n",
    "- **Arccosine ($\\arccos$ or $\\cos^{-1}$): Neither Even nor Odd.** $\\arccos(-x) = \\pi - \\arccos(x)$. Loses even property due to domain restriction $[0, \\pi]$ needed for inverse function definition (cosine is not one-to-one over its full domain).\n",
    "- **Arcsine ($\\arcsin$ or $\\sin^{-1}$) & Arctangent ($\\arctan$ or $\\tan^{-1}$): Odd Functions.** $\\arcsin(-x) = -\\arcsin(x)$, $\\arctan(-x) = -\\arctan(x)$. Domain restrictions for sine and tangent to define inverses preserve odd symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Solving Trigonometric Equations & Problem-Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Principal vs. Reference Angles:** Essential for finding trig values in all quadrants. Reference angles relate angles back to Quadrant I. **Always explicitly write down the reference angle** when finding solutions.\n",
    "- **Considering All Quadrants:** **Crucial to consider all four quadrants** to find complete solutions for trigonometric equations.\n",
    "- **Quadrant Signs (ASTC Rule):** Mastery of ASTC rule for determining signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.\n",
    "- **Zero Product Property:** Applied **zero product property** via factoring to solve trig equations.\n",
    "- **Quadratic Equations in Trigonometry:** Quadratic equations frequently arise and require quadratic formula or factoring techniques.\n",
    "- **Range Awareness:** Importance of knowing function **ranges**. **Be aware that sine and cosine functions always have a range within $[-1, 1]$**. Use this to identify impossible equations and valid solutions quickly.\n",
    "- **Adjusting Interval for Trigonometric Equations with Coefficients:**\n",
    "    - When solving equations like $\\text{trig\\_function}(kt) = \\text{value}$ for $t$ in a given interval $[a, b]$, adjust the interval for the *argument* ($kt$) at the beginning using the Step-by-Step Interval Adjustment Process (see below). The given interval is always for the variable you are solving for ($t$), not directly for the angle inside the trigonometric function ($kt$).\n",
    "    - Crucially, when given a negative interval, visualize angles rotating *clockwise* from the positive x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step-by-Step Interval Adjustment Process for Trigonometric Equations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Given Interval for $t$:** Given interval for $t$: $a \\le t \\le b$ (or $t \\in [a, b]$).\n",
    "2. **Identify Argument:** Argument of the trigonometric function: $kt$.\n",
    "3. **Transform Interval for Argument $kt$:** Transform interval for $t$ to interval for $kt$: Multiply all parts of $a \\le t \\le b$ by $k$ (assume $k > 0$). For division, divide all parts.\n",
    "4. **Solve for Argument $kt$ in Transformed Interval:** Solve trig equation for $kt$ in interval $ka \\le kt \\le kb$. Find all solutions for $kt$ using periodicity & reference angles.\n",
    "5. **Solve for Original Variable $t$:** Solve for $t$ by dividing each solution for $kt$ by $k$: $t = kt/k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Benefit:* Ensures correct number of solutions. Simplifies solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technique: Common Denominator for Range Check:** When working with fractional angles and intervals, **convert interval boundaries to have a common denominator** (related to angle fractions) to simplify comparison and range verification. This makes it easier to see if solutions fall within the correct range.\n",
    "- **Strategy: Step-by-Step Operations:** For complex algebraic manipulations, **perform one operation at a time across all parts of the equation**, writing out each step explicitly. This reduces cognitive load and significantly increases accuracy, especially with signs and fractions. **Write your own division explicitly** instead of relying solely on mental calculation for each step.\n",
    "- **Integer Nature of 'n' in Periodicity:** Remember that in general solutions involving periodicity ($+ 2\\pi n, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), **$n$ can *only* be integers**, not continuous real numbers. This is crucial when finding specific solutions within an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notation Clarity: Interval Notation vs. Set Notation:**\n",
    "    - **Interval Notation (e.g., $[1, 2]$, $(a, \\infty)$):** Represents a **continuous range** of real numbers. Uses $[ ]$ for included endpoints, $( )$ for excluded"
