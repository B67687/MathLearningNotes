    "### **Comprehensive Summary of Learnings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Covered (Building upon previous summaries):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Trigonometry - Half-Angle Formulas:**  Understood the hidden ± sign and the \"complementary pair\" nature of sine and cosine half-angle formulas.\n",
    "*   **Linear Equations:** Mastered standard form (Ax + By = C), slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), handling vertical lines (x = c), and efficiently extracting slope from standard form.\n",
    "*   **Midpoint and Centroid:** Deepened understanding of midpoint for two points and centroid as its generalization for multiple points, recognizing their formulas and the concept of \"average as balance point.\" Explored the distinction between midpoint and centroid, especially when dealing with more than two points, and their relation to data distribution and central tendency.\n",
    "*   **Linear Inequalities and Circles:** Visualized and interpreted regions defined by linear and circular inequalities in the coordinate plane, understanding boundary lines and solid/dashed conventions.\n",
    "*   **Infinity and Cardinality:** Grasped the concept of different sizes of infinity (countable vs. uncountable) and related it to midpoint (continuous line segment - uncountable points) and centroid (finite sets of points - countable points).\n",
    "*   **Finding Standard Equation from Two Points (Fast Method):** Learned a direct method to calculate A, B, and C in Ax + By = C from two points (x₁, y₂) and (x₂, y₂):\n",
    "    *   Δx = x₂ - x₁\n",
    "    *   Δy = y₂ - y₁\n",
    "    *   B = Δx\n",
    "    *   A = -Δy\n",
    "    *   C = Ax₁ + By₁\n",
    "*   **Finding Perpendicular Line Equation (Fast Method):**  Learned to find the equation of a line perpendicular to y = mx + b and passing through (x₀, y₀) using point-slope form and converting to standard form.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Rationalizing Numerator:** Learned that rationalizing the numerator is a valid and sometimes necessary algebraic technique, particularly in calculus.\n",
    "*   **Solving Simple Quadratic Equations Directly:** Recognized that for simple quadratics like `2x² - 1 = 0`, the most efficient method is to isolate `x²` and take the square root. Emphasized the broader principle of choosing the simplest, most direct method for efficiency and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notations and Piecewise Functions (Refined):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interval Notation vs. Set Notation Clarification:**  Distinguished between interval notation (for continuous ranges using `[]`, `()`, `U`) and set notation (general set descriptions using `{ | }`, logical operators).\n",
    "*   **Piecewise Definition of Absolute Value - Unsimplified vs. Simplified:**\n",
    "    *   **Unsimplified form (e.g., `|2x+1| = {2x+1 if 2x+1>=0, -(2x+1) if 2x+1<0 }`):** Quick to write, directly from definition, conditions in terms of expression.\n",
    "    *   **Simplified form (e.g., `|2x+1| = {2x+1 if x>=-1/2, -(2x+1) if x<-1/2 }`):** Conditions simplified to `x`-intervals, generally more practical for graphing, calculus, solving inequalities and readability.  Simplification usually necessary for practical use.\n",
    "    *   **Shortcut of Unsimplified Form:** Can quickly write down definition, but simplification to x-intervals usually follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inequalities - Negation and Order Reversal (Deep Dive):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Rule:** When multiplying or dividing an inequality (or all parts of a double inequality) by a negative number, **reverse the direction of the inequality sign(s)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Understanding *Why*:**\n",
    "    *   **Number Line Visualization:** Reflection across zero reverses order.\n",
    "    *   **Polarity Flip:** Negation flips positive to negative and vice versa, inverting order.\n",
    "    *   **Order Reversal:**  For `a < b < c`, negating all leads to reversed order: `-c < -b < -a`.\n",
    "*   **One-Step Approach for Negation of Double Inequalities (with Caution):** Directly transform terms and reverse signs (e.g., for `a < -b < c`,  `c -> -c`, `-b -> b`, `a -> -a` leading to `-c < b < -a`). Effective if carefully applied and conceptually understood.\n",
    "*   **Two-Step Approach (Conceptual):** 1. Invert order of terms. 2. Change polarity and flip inequality signs.  More conceptually clear for initial learning.\n",
    "*   **Choosing a Method:** One-step can be faster with practice but requires careful attention to both negation and inversion. Two-step is more explicit, potentially reducing errors during learning.  Prioritize conceptual understanding and accuracy over pure speed."
