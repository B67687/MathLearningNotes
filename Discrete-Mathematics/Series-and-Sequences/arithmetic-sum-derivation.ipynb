    "# Understanding Arithmetic Series Sums Through Symmetry of Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of an arithmetic series is a classic result in mathematics, often proven using the method attributed to Gauss, which pairs terms from the ends of the sequence. \n",
    "For example, to sum the numbers $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 100$, Gauss paired terms from the ends ($1 + 100$, $2 + 99$, etc.) to derive the total\n",
    "\n",
    "In this explanation, we present an alternative approach that reveals why this pairing works by focusing on the symmetry of averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method emphasizes conceptual understanding and provides a fresh perspective on the arithmetic series sum, making it particularly suitable for educational settings where intuition is valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Key Idea: Averages as Symmetry on a Number Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s rethink what an average means for numbers in an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a common difference. Instead of just “sum divided by the number of terms,” we can see the average as the central point around which the numbers are symmetrically balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider any term:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large\\boxed{a}\n",

    "\n",
    "If we move a some distance `d` away from the term, we can get to 2 points\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large{\\boxed{a - d} \\longleftarrow a \\longrightarrow \\boxed{a + d}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the way we built this means `a` is average of the 2 points, because we have moved the same amount both left and right with reference to `a`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we keep moving the same amount both directions, `a` will keep being the average\n",
