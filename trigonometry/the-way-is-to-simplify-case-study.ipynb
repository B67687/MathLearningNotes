    "## Raw thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Premise\n",
    "This comes from me trying to fully understand how the R-Formula is derived, and while examining the sequence of A +- x, because I had forgotten whether its A or x first (where I was looking at cos(...)), I had come into a problem where the negation of the entire inner expression A +- x to -A -+ x had the same result as swapping the terms into x +- A, even though in my intuition-guided logic, they don't look like the same expression. So I went to desmos to check, and they both resolved into the same result - the graphs aligned, and I could not believe it, as I was having the false impression that only same processes could result in such a result. Even though I knew of the even-function feature of cosine, I could not resolve the problem that then negation -A -+ x, was the same as the term swapped form x +- A. In hindsight, it was not, but I had panicked because I thought my logic broke down somewhere but I could not feel it. The problem in fact lay in the fact of my wrong assumption that same result must mean same processes, and also my natural doubt to my logic and intuition amplifying on itself, and the lack of adequate speed to calm myself down and simplify the problem until I forced myself to simplify the problem. Where I realised where it went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Original Problem\n",
    "- wait is cos(A-+x) and cos(x-+A) different\n",
    "- I looked at the graphs in desmos, and yes they are the same!\n",
    "- wait but if I just apply the minus to cos(x-+A), then it becomes cos(-x+-A), which is cos(+-A-x), which is not the same as cos(A+-x) though!! How come in desmos it still worked???\n",
    "- wait but if I just apply the minus to cos(x-+A), then it becomes cos(-x+-A), which is cos(+-A-x), which is not the same as cos(A+-x), if we flipped the expressions. so how come in desmos it still worked as if cos(+-A-x) is the same as cos(A+-x)? Did my math go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examining my logic through simplification\n",
    "okay thats so damn complicated, so because my +- sign is a loaded expression, so originally I have A -+ x, which is A - x and A + x. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I apply the negative sign to that whole expression to get -A+-x, I am actually looking at -A + x and -A - x, which corresponds to the negative of the original expanded 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if I flip the terms, I get x -+ A, which is x - A (which is equivalent to -A + x, which is in the negative expression) and  x + A (which is equivalent to A + x, in the original expression). Which means ... -A +- x is infact IS NOT the same as x -+ A. (**EUREKA!**) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concluding the truth\n",
    "And flipping the terms just flip one of the cases (the one containing a difference) to its negative counterpart while keeping one of the cases (the one containing a sum) constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "But because cosine is an even function, both term swapping and whole term negation causes the same answer, but it does not mean that term swapping and whole term negation causes the same effect! it just happens that cosine resolves everything to the same result!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflecting on my methods of problem tackling when in doubt\n",
    "I think this just means I should be more clear about my analysis of problems, just because the result is the same doesnt mean the process is the same, and also vice versa, 2 different processes can create the same result, I had a panic because I had thought the processes must create different results, so I thought my logic was wrong, but i could not find where it was wrong when I flipped the signs. Turns out, I should keep this in mind, and then separate the loaded expression out for clarity, then confirm that those are 2 different processes indeed as I had logic'ed but created the same result due to the even-function characteristic of cosine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I should trust my logic after its 2nd examination, and keep a cool head, then move on to dissection of complicated things to its simpler form, such in the loaded expression of -+ and +- into its distinct forms, sometimes I feel like this is extra work, but when push comes to shove, that is the necessary, and fundamental work to do to understand what is really going on, sometimes my intuition is just lacking. When intuition-main with logic fails, just simplify. We may not be completely sure of our logic, but by simplifying enough we will get to a point where our confidence will be able to tackle its simpler form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic Always Works, it takes Simplicity to enunciate muddy problems to its clarity, where mortal logic will eventually work. And with logic like mine, this won't take long, do not fret the journey to simplification, it pays off in great understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem solving mantra to live by\n",
    "\"Even if you're not sure of your logic at first, simplifying the problem step by step will eventually lead you to a point where the solution becomes clear.\""

    "# **Key Learnings from the Trigonometric Identity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I explored the behavior of trigonometric identities, particularly focusing on expressions involving $A \\mp x$ and $x \\mp A$, and how they interact with cosine and sine functions. Through careful examination, I uncovered several important insights and lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. The Importance of Simplification**\n",
    "- **Complexity can obscure understanding**: At first glance, expressions like $A \\mp x$ and $x \\mp A$ seemed overwhelming due to their \"loaded\" nature (containing both $+$ and $-$ cases).\n",
    "- **Simplification reveals clarity**: By breaking these expressions into their distinct forms ($A - x$, $A + x$, $x - A$, $x + A$), I was able to analyze each case independently and uncover the underlying structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Simplification is not \"extra work\"—it is the **necessary foundation** for understanding complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Same Result ≠ Same Process**\n",
    "- **Different processes can yield the same result**: For example, negating the entire expression ($-(A \\mp x)$) and swapping the terms ($x \\mp A$) produced the same numerical results when evaluated with cosine, but the processes were fundamentally different.\n",
    "- **Cosine's even property hides the differences**: The even property of cosine ($\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$) resolved the differences between the two processes, making them appear equivalent in the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Just because two processes produce the same result does **not** mean they are equivalent. It’s important to understand the underlying logic and properties of the functions involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Intuition vs. Logic**\n",
    "- **Intuition can guide, but logic ensures correctness**: Initially, I relied on intuition to predict how flipping the terms or negating the expression would behave. However, my intuition led to confusion when the results seemed contradictory.\n",
    "- **Logic provided clarity**: By carefully analyzing each step and applying mathematical properties (e.g., the even property of cosine), I was able to resolve the confusion and confirm the correctness of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: When intuition fails, **logic is your best tool**. Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable steps ensures a rigorous and reliable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. The Role of Function Properties**\n",
    "- **Cosine's even property**: The symmetry of the cosine function ($\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$) allowed it to \"resolve\" differences between negation and term swapping, producing the same result.\n",
    "- **Sine's odd property**: If sine were used instead of cosine, the results would differ because $\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$. This highlights how function properties fundamentally affect the behavior of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Understanding the properties of the functions you’re working with is crucial for predicting and explaining their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Confidence Through Simplification**\n",
    "- **Simplification builds confidence**: By breaking the problem into smaller parts and confirming each step, I gained confidence in my understanding, even when the initial process felt uncertain.\n",
    "- **Iterative reasoning is powerful**: Revisiting the problem multiple times, each time focusing on a different aspect, helped me build a deeper and more robust understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Confidence in problem-solving comes from **rigorous analysis** and **iterative refinement**, not from rushing to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. 大道至简 (The Great Way is Simple)**\n",
    "- **Complexity hides simplicity**: The \"loaded\" expressions ($-+$ and $+-$) initially seemed complicated, but by simplifying them into their distinct forms, I uncovered the underlying simplicity.\n",
    "- **The great way emerges through clarity**: By focusing on the fundamentals and stripping away unnecessary complexity, I was able to see the \"great way\" in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: **大道至简**—the most profound truths are often hidden within simplicity. Simplification is the key to understanding and mastery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Reflection**\n",
    "This analysis taught me that:\n",
    "- **Trust your logic after its second examination**: Even when intuition feels uncertain, rigorous logical reasoning will lead you to the correct answer.\n",
    "- **Keep a cool head**: Panicking or rushing can obscure the solution. A calm, methodical approach is essential.\n",
    "- **Simplify, simplify, simplify**: Breaking down complex problems into their simplest components is the most effective way to understand and solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these principles, I not only resolved the confusion in this problem but also strengthened my ability to tackle future challenges with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "- Apply this structured approach to other trigonometric identities and problems.\n",
    "- Continue exploring the properties of sine, cosine, and other functions to deepen my understanding.\n",
    "- Practice simplifying complex expressions regularly to build intuition and confidence.\n",
