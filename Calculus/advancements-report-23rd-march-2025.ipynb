    "    -   $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$.\n",
    "-   Continuity is about the function being \"connected\" without breaks, jumps, or holes.\n",

    "**2. Smoothness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A function is **smooth** if it has a well-defined derivative (i.e., a tangent line) at every point.\n",

    "## Proof: Differentiability Implies Continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook cell explains the proof provided in the image that demonstrates that if a function $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$, then it is also continuous at $x=a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Given:** We are given that $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$. This means that the limit:\n",
    "    $$f'(a) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$\n",
    "    exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Manipulation of f(x) - f(a):**\n",
    "    -   We can rewrite $f(x) - f(a)$ as:\n",
    "        $$f(x) - f(a) = \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} (x - a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Taking the Limit:**\n",
    "    -   Taking the limit of both sides as $x \\to a$:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} (f(x) - f(a)) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\left[ \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} (x - a) \\right]$$\n",
    "    -   Using limit properties:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} (f(x) - f(a)) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \\cdot \\lim_{x \\to a} (x - a)$$\n",
    "    -   Since $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = f'(a)$ (from step 1) and $\\lim_{x \\to a} (x - a) = 0$, we have:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} (f(x) - f(a)) = f'(a) \\cdot 0 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Connecting to Continuity:**\n",
    "    -   We want to show that $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$, which is the definition of continuity.\n",
    "    -   We can rewrite $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ as:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} [f(a) + (f(x) - f(a))]$$\n",
    "    -   Using limit properties:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a} f(a) + \\lim_{x \\to a} (f(x) - f(a))$$\n",
    "    -   Since $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(a) = f(a)$ (because $f(a)$ is a constant) and $\\lim_{x \\to a} (f(x) - f(a)) = 0$ (from step 3), we have:\n",
    "        $$\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) + 0 = f(a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Conclusion:**\n",
    "    -   We have shown that $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$, which is the definition of continuity at $x=a$.\n",
    "    -   Therefore, if $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=a$, it is also continuous at $x=a$."

    "**1. Standard Practice:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The rationale behind writing the expression first is to emphasize the function's behavior, which is the core concept of limits and derivatives.\n",
    "-   In derivatives, we're examining the *rate of change* of the function, which is captured by the expression $\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$ or $\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$.\n",
    "-   Writing this expression first allows us to perform algebraic manipulations before considering the limit itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why Standard Practice is Preferred:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Readability:** The standard notation allows for a smoother flow of reading, as the reader immediately understands the context of the expression.\n",
    "-   **Consistency:** Consistent notation is essential for clear communication in mathematics.\n",
    "-   **Established Convention:** Mathematical notation is often based on established conventions that have evolved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Recommendation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is recommended to follow the standard practice of writing the limit notation to the left of the expression.\n",
    "-   This ensures that your notation is consistent with common mathematical conventions and avoids potential confusion.\n",
    "-   If you prefer writing the expression first, you can leave a space for the limit notation to the left, but ultimately the limit notation should be placed to the left."
