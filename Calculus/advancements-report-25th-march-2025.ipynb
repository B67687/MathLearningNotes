    "- **Product Rule vs. Expansion and Power Rule:**\n",
    "    - While the product rule is a fundamental differentiation rule, it's not always the most efficient method for calculations.\n",
    "    - For polynomial expressions, expanding the product and applying the power rule is generally faster and less error-prone.\n",
    "    - The product rule is more useful when dealing with functions that cannot be easily expanded (e.g., products of trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions).\n",

    "- **Algebraic Simplification:**\n",
    "    - Simplifying expressions before differentiation can significantly reduce the complexity of the calculation and minimize the risk of errors.\n",
    "    - This is especially important when dealing with radicals and fractional exponents.\n",

    "    - Carefully review algebraic rules and double-check your work, especially when dealing with complex expressions.\n",
