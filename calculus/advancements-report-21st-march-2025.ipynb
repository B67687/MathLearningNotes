    "The epsilon-delta proof is a rigorous way to show that a limit exists. Here's a general procedure:\n",

    "1.  **State the Limit:** Clearly write the limit you want to prove, e.g., $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **State the Definition:** Recall the epsilon-delta definition: For every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Start with |f(x) - L|:** Begin by manipulating the expression $|f(x) - L|$ algebraically to relate it to $|x - c|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Find a Bound for |x - c|:**\n",
    "    - If necessary, find a bound for other terms in the expression involving *x*. This often involves assuming a bound for $|x - c|$ (e.g., $|x - c| < 1$).\n",
    "    - Use this bound to find an upper limit for the other terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Express |x - c| in Terms of Epsilon:**\n",
    "    - Use the manipulated expression and the bounds to find a condition on $|x - c|$ that ensures $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$.\n",
    "    - This will give you an inequality of the form $|x - c| < \\text{expression involving } \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Choose Delta:**\n",
    "    - Choose $\\delta$ to satisfy the condition found in the previous step.\n",
    "    - If you used a preliminary bound for $|x - c|$, you might need to choose $\\delta$ as the minimum of that bound and the expression involving $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Verify the Condition:**\n",
    "    - Show that if $0 < |x - c| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon$.\n",
